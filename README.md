# PrecipitationNowcasting
This project uses the Agrimet 15-min Precipitation dataset (2014-2017) to train an RNN prediction network for precipitation using 25 15-min timesteps as input and 6 hour cumulative precipitation as forecast output. The baseline RNN system is then supplemented with the NEXRAD RADAR Images dataset from which the 3-hour precipitation accumulations
